    <h1>A Smoked Salmon Sandwich Recipe Perfect For Lunch</h1>
    <p>All the great flavors that make this such a satisfying breakfast are still here — 
        the richness of smoked salmon, the bite of onion and capers, the sweetness of tomato — 
        but by ditching the oversize bagel in favor of whole wheat toast, 
        you save about 200 calories and trade a ton of refined carbs for a boost of fiber.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1⁄4 cup whipped cream cheese</li>
        <li>8 slices whole-wheat or 9-grain bread, toasted</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp capers, rinsed and chopped</li>
        <li>1⁄2 red onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 cups mixed baby greens</li>
        <li>1 large tomato, sliced</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>8 oz smoked salmon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to cook</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Spread 1 tablespoon of the cream cheese on each of four slices of toast.</li>
        <li>Top each with capers, onion, greens, and a slice or two of tomato.</li>
        <li>Lightly salt the tomato, then add as much pepper as you'd like (this sandwich cries out for a lot of it).</li>
        <li>Finish by draping a few slices of smoked salmon over the tomatoes and topping with the remaining slices of toasted bread.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Eat This Tip</h2>
    <p>Looking for a money-saving strategy? Try subbing in smoked turkey, ham, or even canned tuna. 
        The nutritional info won't change much and it will still be twice as satisfying as any breakfast sandwich you can score from a drive-thru window.</p>
