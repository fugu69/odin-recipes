    <h1>Why you’ll love this protein brownies recipe</h1>
    <p>What I love about these brownies is that they taste incredible and have the best fudgy texture - 
        everything you need in a healthy chocolate dessert!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Almond butter</li>
        <li>Banana</li>
        <li>Cocoa powder</li>
        <li>Protein powder</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Mix-ins. Optional, but I love to add some dark chocolate chips, 
            vanilla extract, or chopped dark chocolate.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to cook</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the batter. Start by adding all your ingredients into a high-speed blender or food processor. 
            Blend the ingredients together until fully combined. If desired, add some chocolate chips. 
            You can also mix by hand in a large mixing bowl. </li>
        <li>Bake. Then, transfer the batter into a lined pan and bake for 15-20 minutes, 
            or until a skewer comes out ‘just’ clean. While the brownies are hot in the pan, 
            lightly press your hand over the top to form unnatural cracky tops. </li>
        <li>Cool then slice. Allow the brownies to cool in the pan completely before drizzling with chocolate and slicing them up. </li>

    </ol>
    <h2>How to store</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To store: Leftovers should be stored in the refrigerator, covered, 
            as they will spoil at room temperature. They will keep well for up to five days. </li>
        <li>To freeze: Place the brownies in an airtight container and store them in the freezer for up to 6 months. </li>
    </ul>
